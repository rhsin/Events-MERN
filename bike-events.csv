One of the biggest areas this drama played itself out was in the Corners region of northeast Texas, where Grayson, Fannin, Hunt, and Collin Counties converge, in an area known as “Wildcat Thicket.” This thicket was massively dense, and was home to panthers, wolves, bears, and wildcats... It was said that if you wandered into it, that you might never make your way out again. For this reason, it was an ideal haven for army deserters, outlaws, and renegades.",,https://www.greenvillegravel.com/renegade-rambler-100,Cycling
